# Hydra
OS can be a collection of subsystems. Hydra is a microkernel to provide the necessary support for being able to implement user level subsystems.   
### Key Terms  
* Protection Domain  
* Protected Control Transfer  
* Rights Augmentation  


#### Hydra wants users to be able to design their subsystem, and define their protection domain, control transfer, and rights augmentation.   
### Abstractions of Hydra:  
* Resources -> Objects
* Execution Domain -> Local Namespace (stack frames)
* Protection mechanism -> “Capability” (Pointers, with right bits)
