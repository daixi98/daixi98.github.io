# Lottery Scheduling
In lottery scheduling, every process has some tickets. The scheduler picks a random ticket and executes the owner process of that ticket for a time slice. A process having a higher number of tickets has more chance to get chosen for execution.   

There are many interesting mechanisms in lottery scheduling. For example, a process can distribute tickets to its threads, or transfer tickets to others. Another example is the compensation mechanism, if a winner does not use a full time slice, it can gain compensation tickets to increase their probability to win in the near future.
