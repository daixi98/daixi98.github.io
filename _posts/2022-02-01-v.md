# V  
## Goals:  
1.	Diskless systems are not much slower than machines with a local disk.  
2.	Use messages and IPC to implement high performance remote file I/O.  
## Features of the original V IPC:  
1.	Synchronized, not streaming. Clients are blocked after sending a message, and wait for a response. (TCP is streaming)   
2.	Small message size: 32 bytes. V separates control from data, and there is a separate API to control data transfer. This can be bad in terms of sending small messages through network. So, V adds two additional APIs to send the control message with data.  

Experiment: Doing operations locally vs remotely (local Ethernet segment)  
Result: Remote operations add milliseconds of time to the operation.  
But, the operations of the disk are expensive, whose time is much larger than the network penalty.  
 
### How V optimizes the synchronized communication?   
The client sends request and is blocked, but the server keeps sending data blocks. (Actually, it is streaming) The client only needs to acknowledge the last packet. (They are assuming the packet drop rate is low)  
                    C ----------> S
                    C <---------- S
                    C <---------- S
                    C <---------- S
                    C <---------- S
                    C <---------- S
                    C ----------> S

When we improve the performance, do not only focus on individual operations, but also see what the impact is on overall execution time.
